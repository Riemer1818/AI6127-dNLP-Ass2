# AI6127-dNLP-Ass2

Assignment for the AI6127 course on deep natural language processing at NTU.


- [ ] Warm up: Read, understand, and reimplement the examples in the code base  
- [ ] Run the example code base and record the Rouge scores for test set (Rouge 1 and Rouge 2) 
- [ ] Change the GRU in Encoder and Decoder in the code base with LSTM, run the code, and record the Rouge scores for test set 
- [ ] Change the GRU in Encoder (not Decoder) in the code base with bi-LSTM, run the code, and record the Rouge scores for test set 
- [ ] Add the attention mechanism between Encoder and Decoder in the original code base (you can refer to Lecture 8 for attention mechanism), run the code, and record the Rouge scores for test set 
- [ ] Change the GRU in Encoder (not Decoder) in the original code base with Transformer Encoder, run the code, and record the Rouge scores for test set.
